A large group of cars is driving down a rough road, filled to bursting with equipment and personnel.


It truly is quite a sight to behold. As a result of slapping microwave collectors on practically anything that still had wheels, we've become a menagerie of trucks, buses, cars, cranes and various other more specialized vehicles. My group is on a large private tour bus. The road is rough, so the bus just shakes and shakes. We're hurtling on at break-neck speed, too.


Satellite power allows us to travel at high speeds without any fuel. Because of this, we can shorten what would have been a half-week trek to the city ruins into just six hours. Compared to merchant caravans, which could take even more time than on foot if they weren't careful, this is quite the improvement.


If only I could endure this nightmarish ride.


"Uungh-"


I'm even sitting by the window, but the nausea just continues to well up from within me.


"......"


"Huh? Am I okay? No, not at all, I'm at death's door."


"...! (He's flustered.)"


The only one who's worried about me is the Assistant, who is sitting next to me.


Grandfather and the other members of the Boys and Girls Science Club are happily chatting away.


"I want to feel the wind..."


Cold air flows in as I open the window. The fresh air feels good. But when I unconsciously try to lean forward, the Assistant pulls me back from behind.


"......"


"Huh? It's dangerous to lean forward? But if I don't, it'll be dangerous in a different way."


I settle for placing my chin on the window frame.


"The king's got donkey ears[^donkey], and this bus smells like whiteboard markers~"


[^donkey]: This is a reference to an old fable where a king grows donkey ears, but nobody notices but his barber or some other mook. The mook feels he needs to get that secret off his chest, so he goes and screams it out into a forest, like what Watashi is doing here. The story ends with the echos of the mook's screams somehow making their way back to the king, who gets mad at the forest and cuts it down.


I present my complaints to the scenery.


"......"


He's saying it's taking awfully long.


"We're here..."


I get off the bus and plant myself firmly onto my beloved ground, desperate to regain my sense of balance.


"If I'd eaten anything before, my stomach would probably have emptied itself by now."


"So, the youngest are the first ones to tire, eh?"


Grandfather sure is in the pink, huh.


"I'm the one who had to fight the hardest on the bus, so could you spare me that?"


"What do you mean?" I ask the Assistant.


"......"


"What? A Fighting Spirit Award?"[^fighto]


[^fighto]: Yes, they have a word for this. It was in the dictionary.


That's right, I did fight bravely.


"In other words, you're drunk."


"I'm still dizzy..."


In moments of carelessness, I can still feel hints of a raging party stirring about at the back of my throat. But I'd rather said scene got broken up, ASAP.


"You got drunk at the caravan, didn't you?"


"The speed and shaking were on a whole new level..."


"There's no helping it. We're going to get to the initial investigation now, you guys can take a break right here. You know how to read a map, yes? Meet up with us *here* once you feel better."


"Yes, we'll do so."


I scuttle on all fours into one of the tents that someone has set up. I need to lie down for now. This tent is big enough for about eight people to sleep in, and already has mattresses laid down. I occupy one and stretch out my limbs. The sounds of a great migration of scholars filter through the tent to me.


Everyone's so energetic...


As I see them off in my mind's eye, I surrender myself to a shallow sleep.


I think I slept for about an hour.


My equilibrium seems to have returned, and I appear to be fully recovered. When I leave the tent, the silence of the deserted investigation camp seems to cling to my skin.


Tents are pitched in an array reminiscent of a nomadic village. A bunch of measuring devices are lined up on folding desks. Bundles of power cords snake along the ground. Several heavy machines wait their turn atop some trailers.


"How amazing, there's even a refrigerator."


What's more, it's an industrial one. Inside, I find meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, and alcohol.


It portends the resurgence of an age of plenty. There's enough alcohol in here to serve a banquet.


From somewhere in the forest of tents (It really does feel that way to me), rises a white plume. In an open space like a small hall, I find the Assistant boiling water on a portable stove. He gives me a drowsy look.


"......"


"Huh? Tea time? Thank you for that. Allow me to dig in."


The simple scent of the plain tea he hands me tickles my nose.


I spend a long time enjoying my drink.


"Now then, let's head to the ruins. Carry this heavy thing on your back."


I load two rucksacks to the brim with supplies.


Inside are food and water, portable stoves, survival kits and medicines, tools like knives and flashlights, and a few changes of clothes. I pay special care to the allocation of food and water; there's about a week's worth of food, and four liters of water for each person (One liter of which is in a canteen).


Well, a good amount of this water will also end up getting brewed with the tea and coffee bags we're bringing along.


... If it weren't for the fairy's warning, I wouldn't have thought to carry such a heavy load. I have a bad feeling about this.


From this small hill where the camp has been set up, we get a sweeping view of the city ruins in question.


The city spreads out over the hilly area filled with nascent greenery like a giant lying on its back.


It is divided into two areas.


The center of the city is quite conspicuous, while the outskirts look like just another run-of-the-mill city.


From afar, there is what appears to be a blob of mercury bulging out on top of a pane of glass. This is the city's center, the so-called heart of the city. Just like how mercury bunches up instead of spreading out, the center of the city is composed of only one massive structure, not multiple buildings. It must be about five hundred meters tall; just looking at the size of it gives me chills. It is unclear if it really is just one single dome-like structure, or if it was formed through the agglomeration of multiple buildings. In any case, if it were assumed to be just one single building, its internal structure likely reaches the height of complexity. We probably won't be investigating that far into it right now, though.


The metallic color of the material it is constructed from leaves a strong impression given its uniformity. The dome gleams wondrously in various shades, from argentine, to a vivid leaden color depending on how the light hits it. It really does look like a city of mercury.


As is typical for most ruins, there are signs of extensive erosion by wind, rain and plants all over the outer city. I have seen many decayed wooden structures in the wilderness before, but this city's buildings are much better preserved than most. Most cities are usually more than half-eaten by vegetation at this point, and few exist that are this slow to erode.


The investigation will begin on the outer edge.


The Assistant is staring into the heart of the city, transfixed.


"You're quite interested in the city, aren't you, Assistant? Shall we get going?"


He gives me a firm nod when I ask him.


<hr/>


"There doesn't seem to be much need for physical work like excavation, so we've decided to just continue gathering information as we have been doing so far."


We manage to safely convene with Grandfather near one of the main streets of the city's outskirts. It appears that most of the other members have already split up to conduct their part of the investigation, so we two are the only ones here to receive this explanation.


"I'm sure you're curious about the huge building in the center, but we have no plans to go that far at this time. We'll be steadily investigating things starting from the outer edge. Books and documents are well and good, but our main objective is electronic information, you got that? The investigation will proceed in pairs, and everyone has their designated sectors. If you find anything, make sure to put it up for discussion, and we can adjust how personnel are allotted."


"Where are we to be assigned?"


"I've found a low-priority area for you two to explore. It's the kind of place where you won't cause much damage in the unlikely event that apprentices like you make a mistake and wreck an information device."


"... You've got zero trust in us, huh."


"This is also keeping your safety in mind."


"Wait, did I just hear something scary just now?"


Safety? Danger?


"As you might have noticed, there are a lot of machines that operate automatically when supplied power. Certain places can be very dangerous because of this. You need to be especially careful when facing an unknown mechanism. However, there's no need to worry about things like that where you're going."


"Why?"


"It's because we've chosen a safe area with no facilities around."


"Mm..."


So we're getting dealt the short end of the stick.


"You seem dissatisfied. Well, I suppose I could see where your ambitions lie. Where are you interested in investigating?"


"Over there."


I point to the heart of the city without hesitation. Grandfather's face contorts in disappointment.


"... It shows how naive you are, that you're so bewitched by the flashy things."


"We're supposed to be investigating these ruins, though, sheesh. Places like that are probably where the most glory is to be had!"


"Not happening. We don't know how fragile that structure could be. We only make limited contact with high-rise buildings, and it's not something we can leave you to handle. Also, though it isn't likely to happen, make sure you don't go anywhere near the power plant in the suburbs.""


"What do you mean by that?"


"It's a facility that collects high amplitude microwave radiation and converts it to electricity. You get that? You could get fried to a crisp without even touching anything if you're in the wrong place. It's dangerous. Also, the power collection facility is an extremely important place in and of itself. We've spent years investigating and maintaining it. Messing with any of the knobs there could cause all sorts of problems, and in the worst-case scenario, we could even lose our connection to the power satellite. It's doubly dangerous, so entry is prohibited."


"Then where would it be okay to mess around?" I ask, in a throwaway tone.


"Oh, here."


The indicated area looks cramped, almost like a slit.


The only indication of something meaningful being there is a `W` mark.


"I wonder what this mark means?"


"It meant there was a public restroom there, in the old days."


<hr/>


We walk through the old, futuristic streets.


Buildings that aren't stone or wood are lined up neatly on either side of the road. Though these buildings can't be termed as high-rises, they still happen to be between three and five stories tall.


"... We can't enter any of these buildings, huh... Which means..."


It's going to be a long investigation.


The Assistant and I walk down the middle of the road, careful not to get caught up in any debris.


The road is wide enough for twenty people to walk abreast, and the plazas seem to be wider still.


"There must have been a lot of people living here."


"......"


"Huh? What is it?"


The Assistant points to the ground. A person lies there, reduced to their bones.


"That's not a person, it's a <i>former</i> person."


"......"


"Huh? Oh, that's... a garbage truck, I think. I saw something similar in an old movie."


A large garbage truck lies tipped over on the side of the road. It's a mystery as to what kind of situation could have toppled something as bulky as that.


"But everything is so well-preserved that it all looks less like a ruin, and more like it were just abandoned."


Even though things look weathered, nothing appears broken beyond repair. The only indication that any time has passed is a road sign, so damaged by corrosion that it lies, crumpled, on the road. Which means this city went quietly, with nary a sign of any uprisings.


"Interesting, but let's focus on our own work for now."


We've arrived at our destination.


"........."


I look down, double-checking the map one more time.


"This is it, yes?"


There should be a small park in the area we're in charge of.


But no, no park here. It has vanished.


Instead, we find a mound of what appears to be solidified mercury, of the same color as the city's center. A girthy pipe sticks out of the ground next to the mound. It seems like the pipe might have been a conduit for molten metal, which could explain the metal hill before us.


"I wonder what this was for."


I can only think of the word "reclamation".


I try examining it, but the metal stands resolute against my investigations, and I'm left without answers. It is as if a drop of mercury just so happened to drip off the city's center.


The Assistant and I go around in opposite directions to investigate.


He beckons to me.


"Did you find anything?"


"......"


"Huh? This is a..."


The entrance to an elevator is embedded on the side of the mound.


The door is still open, and I can see a small space that could accommodate about four people at once. The two of us walk in for a look. And as soon as we do, the door shuts.


"Assistant... Did you...?"


There was a switch blinking on that control panel, wasn't there?


"You pushed it, didn't you?"


I ask with a smile.


"... (Nods)"


"What're we going to do if we use some unknown machinery without authorization..."


The room has begun to move.


"Ah, too late..."


To think we'd actually end up doing just that...


There are no windows, so I can't quite tell where we're going, but judging by how my body is pressed downwards, I believe we are rising rapidly.


"Haha, is this a lift?"


The Assistant is staring intently at his finger.


Perhaps the power of science, which enables one's fingertips to casually enact wonders, is bewitching him.


"Let me see for a second."


I press a button on the panel with a mind to stop the elevator. But the elevator doesn't seem to respond to any of the buttons on the panel.


"Looks like we aren't stopping until we reach our destination."


The elevator seems to be able to move in every direction, going up, down, left, and right. It draws a complicated three-dimensional trajectory. For each change of direction, we slant like a certain leaning tower, nearly enter free-fall, and even get half-crushed by our own weight.


"Ah, it switched to moving horizontally... Ah, now it's going down... Ugh... I-It's going up again?"


The enclosed room shudders, and I feel like I'm very close to being motion-sick again. It is painfully cramped in here.


"Ugh, I might not make it..."


I clap my hands over my mouth and lean against the wall. The Assistant rubs my back, but it isn't helping much. I'd like to refrain from "taking it easy" in this situation, seeing as I don't even have a sick bag. But just as I'm on the verge of losing my fight against the rising pressure within me, the elevator finally stops.


"That took way, way too long..."


A super exclusive, high-class "Pong" (as opposed to the cheap, plebeian "beep" of a buzzer) sounds, and the doors open left and right.


Before us is another tightly locked room.


"It's pitch dark."


No lights and no windows. The faint light flowing into the room from the elevator isn't enough to cover the entire area.


It is quite frightening to think we're exploring this dark place without even knowing if we're above or underground right now.


"We should probably go back. I'm not looking forward to the motion sickness though..."


One of the buttons in the elevator should take us back to where we started.


But when I turn back to the panel, I find dozens of buttons labeled with a hybrid-coded table of numbers, alphabet and Chinese characters.


"It's so detailed! Wh-which button was it originally?"


"...?"


He just shakes his head from side to side, his expression blank.


"You pushed it even though you didn't know what it would do?!"


He gives me a look as if wondering why I'm getting angry. What a problem child...


"If we push another button without knowing what it does, it could take us to an even stranger location."


... That seems very likely.


What should we do? Should we investigate this place and find a way to get back ourselves, or should we try to forge our way through and discover as much as we can? Now that I think about it, I have a communicator, don't I. They'd distributed communicator devices to each investigation team back at the start.


"A communicator. Now that's what I call the convenience of civilization. Hooray."


This communicator that resembles a stick of chewing gum has hinges that let it expand to the size of a business card. It's quite easy to use. All you have to do to talk to someone is press the shortcut key registered to their frequency. When the person on the other end picks up, you then put it to your ear and talk.


"......... I can't get through."


The communicator is making some kind of beeping noise, but it doesn't seem to be able to connect a call at the moment. Instead, a strange message starts playing.


"Currently unable to connect. Please excuse the inconvenience, and try again later."


"It should be functioning properly, so why?"


But when I look closer, I notice there isn't a single bar on the antenna icon that shows the signal status.


"A bad signal... Shouldn't be possible..."


I can't imagine there are that many frequencies interfering with each other here... Oh, could the microwave power signal be interfering with it?


No, that can't be. I mean, this communicator was purpose-built to be used within a microwave-powered zone.


"Looks like we aren't going to be able to make any calls from here..."


I don't know why, but that seems to be the case. I carefully consider our situation as I support my forehead, which feels like it might just fall off from the shock of it all.


"First things first, light."


It's time for the flashlight. I'm glad I packed it. I promptly cast a beam of light into the darkness.


"This is a big place."


We seem to be inside a large hall, about the size of three small cabins lined up together.


Nothing that could be considered furniture remains. There are only the thick cylindrical columns that act as vertical support beams for the ceiling. But as the light plays over these features, I notice something that stands out.


"It looks like a stone slab."


I walk up to it and examine it further.


It's about two meters tall. Quite a large monolith. That said, there's still a gap of over a meter between it and the ceiling. The slab appears to have been brought here from elsewhere, instead of having been here from the start. It's made of stone. Its purpose seems ornamental, and the workmanship looks hurried. I can tell, because the edges are somewhat jagged.


I feel like I'm seeing monoliths everywhere now... Is this a new fad or something?


Hah, as if.


As I move my gaze -- as well as the light beam -- up from the base, the light illuminates words carved near the center.


"Umm... What's this?"


"Oyaji"


That's what it says. Haven't I heard that name somewhere before?


I move the light further up.


"...!"


And see something *dreadful*.


Near the zenith of the Monolith, just above the writing, is a bleached skeleton, stuck in place with a gigantic thumb tack. Th-This, this is a... 


"... Warning."


This is one of those displays that just screams, "This is our turf, so back off if ya know whass good fer ya."


"I don't know the exact era, but there have been times when public order had been quite bad."


I hear a chime behind me and turn around, only to see the elevator's doors closing.


"Ah, wait..."


I break into a trot and fall onto the elevator's external panel. Unfortunately, the elevator is already moving by the time I reach the panel.


"If I want to call it back here..."


I press buttons blindly, but no light shines that would indicate that input was accepted. I'm starting to think that this external panel might be broken.


"... How can this be?"


It seems we have no choice but to move on.


"But even if we need to move, does this hall even have an exit...?"


I brandish the torch at the gloom, but the beam disappears before it can even reach the far wall. A deep, dense darkness. I take a deep breath and step behind the monolith. As we put the elevator behind us, the darkness promptly swallows us both.


Fortunately, we immediately run into a wall. I point the beam to the right, revealing an old metal door held ajar.


"Let's take a peek."


The door is only barely cracked open, so we can't pass through without some extra effort. We pull the metal door open together. The sound of the warped underside of the door scraping against the floor rings out. Though I know there is nobody else here, I'm still gripped by the irrational fear that a denizen of the Monolith Kingdom might discover us.


The door seems to have stayed open due to friction with the floor.


I stick my upper body out into the space on the other side and illuminate it with my flashlight.


Outside is a dreadfully narrow hallway.


It is so bizarrely narrow, that if two people were to pass each other within it, they would inevitably brush shoulders. The walls and floor are, similarly to the hall we are in, completely bare. However, the ceiling of the hallway is tightly packed with a jumble of raw metal pipes. And, sure enough, the hallway is shrouded in darkness, making it impossible to see.


"Not really a place one would be enthused to explore, hmm?"


I check the inside of the hall again but find no other doors. In other words, proceed we must.


"Shall we go?"


Just as I ask him that, a strange sound echoes from his abdomen.


Grumble.


The Assistant puts both hands to his stomach, and quietly gives me a look as if he were making a speech.


"...(<i>Grrmbrble</i>)"


"Are you hungry?"


"...(<b><i>Grrmmmmble</i></b>)"


The growling is incessant.


I wasn't bothered by it since I'd been motion-sick earlier, but it seems I'm also rather peckish now.


"Let's eat before we leave."


I open my pack and make a simple meal of three tinned crackers and a few slices of salted chicken tenders each. Something hot to eat or drink would have been nice, but there isn't time to boil anything. We make do with cold water.


The Assistant doesn't complain at all about the bland meal (Though I will say I made every effort I could to diversify the menu), but he does give me a few curious looks.


"You're asking if I went out of my way to prepare portable rations because I knew this would happen? Not at all. It's just a coincidence."


"........."


Looks like he still has his doubts. I pretend to be the senior (When, in truth, the Assistant is mine) and give him a glossed-over explanation.


"I'm a mediator. And interacting with fairies on a daily basis means I'm sure to get into trouble. What if I can't protect myself in the event of an emergency? I just did what was natural. The best insurance you have is the thoroughness of your preparation. That's the minimum you must do to earn the title of being a member of society."


"...(Clap, clap, clap)"


There's no shortage of applause and praise in his eyes. It feels good to whitewash the truth. Because the real reason could be summarized in one word as "self-preservation", which is rather anticlimactic in contrast.


I mean, it doesn't look like the fairies are going to help me this time. I don't want to die, or get hurt, you know; I want a long, deathless life (I feel strongly about this, among other things).


Incidentally, I'm also averse to wandering about blindly like this, but I suppose I'll have to accept my fate.


"Now then, let's get going. We must confirm our current position, and meet up with the main group again."


We're in the middle of a pitch-black hallway.


The flashlight I have with me is compact, but still very powerful. It's a reassuring light source, with a throw easily reaching ten meters. But even so, the darkness closing in around us is overwhelmingly oppressive. I can feel my nerves fraying. This hallway is longer and more complicated than I could have imagined.


We encounter many bends, but not a single door. This hallway's construction is the epitome of chaotic and irresponsible design. It is like an artificial cave.


We wander through this man-made cave for quite a long time. I pull out the communicator every once in a while, but it can't seem to catch a signal. The sound of the gravel crunching under our feet reverberates sharply in the stagnant silence.


"Strange. I wonder why this hall was made this way."


This tight corridor. Why did this city, densely populated as it might have been, need such a twisted, space-wasting path as this? 


Was it because of excessive remodeling?


Did the changes accumulate over time, until urban planning failed to keep up, resulting in this mess?


"There's a staircase. Watch your step, Assistant."


We descend the stairs, only to find the twisted path continuing on before us.


"It's not like this path is just growing like some vine, is it?"


"........."


I grumble to myself as we continue walking.


"Oh, a light."


When we turn a corner, we spot a strong light pouring down from above, a short distance in front. Having moved under the light, we discover it is in fact sunlight, not artificial.


"It's warm..."


Smells like an early summer afternoon. We've only been in this darkness for a few dozen minutes, but even that is enough to make me sorely miss the outside world.


A large hole in the ceiling, made by some falling object. That's what has allowed this light to shine through. This hole must've been a normal, run-of-the-mill ceiling in the past. But a hole about a meter wide has been punched in it now. Thanks to the destruction, I can get a good view of the roughly fifty-centimeter cross-section of the structure. It appears to consist of layers upon layers of insulation and metal plating, like some kind of overstuffed sandwich. It reminds me of geological strata.


"It seems to be made from a special material. Is that structure intended to increase material strength?"


Where the falling object seems to have hit the floor is a radial pattern of cracks. It's as if someone had smashed the ground with a sledgehammer. I don't see any signs of the object that could have caused this, however. Perhaps someone else has already taken it away. This might have happened decades, or even centuries ago. It's impossible to say what this fallen object could have been.


As I gauge the distance to the hole in the ceiling, a sigh of lament escapes my lips.


"It would be nice if we could get out through here, but that idea is a non-starter. We would never be able to reach."


But even if <i>we</i> can't get up there, radio waves might. There's only one bar of reception on the corner of the small display. Would that be enough to connect? I put the communicator to my ear with that faint hope.


"It's you, huh? What's-"


Just when I thought the connection was stable, a powerful burst of static interrupts the call. Grandfather is probably saying something, but I can't hear a word of it. I get the same result no matter how many times I call him.


"It isn't as bad as before, but... I don't think we'll be able to have a proper conversation like this."


I'm not inclined to move away from the sunlight, but we decide to go deeper into the corridor. The knowledge that the surface is right above us lightens my step. We turn a few corners, go up some stairs, go down some other stairs, and eventually, reach the first branch in our path.


"Looks like it's finally starting to look like a maze. Assistant, could you give me that silver-looking metal case in your bag?"


The pencil-box-shaped case is filled to the brim with long, thin gelatinous cylinders. They're called chemical lights, and when bent hard, a reaction occurs that allows them to glow for a long time. I take one out, bend it into a less-than sign's shape, confirm it has begun glowing, and then place it on the ground.


Because these lights take advantage of the half-life of radioactive material, they can apparently keep glowing for up to ten years, if not more. It's nice that electricity allows for the production of such handy items through things like all-purpose plants.


"......"


"Huh? It's shiny and pretty? It's a landmark. So we don't get lost if we come back here."


I pick the right path and continue onwards. After walking for a while, we spot a large pair of double doors on one of the walls. The doors don't seem to need electricity. The Assistant and I force the doors open together.


"It seems this is a warehouse."


This is quite a large room. Judging by the faint glow of the flashlight against the wall, it seems to be about ten meters long. It has no furnishings or windows. The only prominent features are a number of tall metal partitions standing in a row. They are already rusty and beginning to warp under their own weight. In short, they are cabinets.


"Why don't we take a look?"


"......"


We pick a cabinet each, then, following proper thieving etiquette, open shelves from the bottom up. Doing it this way keeps us from having to close shelves we've already opened again, shortening the time we spend. If a shelf is warped and won't open, we skip it. This isn't meant to be a very thorough investigation anyway.


The first one is empty. The second has only a screw in it. The third contains a bunch of rags that are on the verge of crumbling away, while the fourth just has a collection of simple tools scattered within.


"It doesn't look like this place saw much use."


One would normally be able to find a few important documents in such a place that would hint at its purpose.


"Found anything over there?"


The boy indicates with his movements alone that he has found nothing.


I indifferently register the existence of a different set of stairs, but there aren't any other treasures of note here.


"...? (I found a small medal-type thing, you know?)"


"I don't need it."


I throw it away.


"......... (Looking sad)"


"B-But that coin was minted at the Children's Bank! It's a toy... Just a toy!"


It would be a problem if I allowed such a thing to traumatize him in his childhood.


We search the whole room but find nothing in the end.


"I guess that's about it. Let's hurry on."


As we go up and down stairs, sometimes climbing ladders, and walking the long, long hallway, I find that I've completely lost track of where we're headed.


One thing I've understood is that this mosaic of a city is far more chaotic than I expected it to be. It looked strange from the outside, and its interior is not to be outdone. As we continue our search, the feeling only grows stronger and stronger. We find a few more rooms and warehouses along the way, but the only thing we find in the ruins is more rubbish lying around.


The unorthodox complexity of the corridors, the ominous and abrupt layout of the various rooms. It doesn't seem to be the product of proper urban planning. What did the residents of this city, when it was still full of life, intend by constructing such an inscrutable labyrinth?


The lack of any living facilities is puzzling. Perhaps this area is just half-finished, maybe it wasn't ever used in the first place, or maybe there is something else to it.


I continue walking, my mind full of questions.


Six hours later, we stop walking. For the first time, we come across an area with working lighting.


"Finally... Something that works..."


It appears to be a vast hall, turned into an indoor park.


This area is large. At the least, it is several times larger than the hall we'd entered from. I can't help but wonder why a park would be built in such a suffocating room when there was plenty of nature to see outside, but there's nothing to do but accept that extenuating circumstances required staying indoors at all times.


The artificial grass covering the room's floor feels strange, but it actually does help improve my mood. Right under the one single streetlight that still functions is a bench. After that long, hard, cold walk through that hallway, we were exhausted.


I sit down next to the Assistant on the bench, and my whole body goes limp.


"Any more walking and my legs are going to hurt. Let's continue onwards tomorrow."


"........."


It's been a while since I've looked at the Assistant's face like this. He seems slightly pale from exhaustion.


The communicator is still out of service. I'm sure Grandfather is going to be worried about the lack of communication for a whole night... But it's not without precedent, so I'm sure he will deal with things calmly.


"I don't think we can expect a rescue team to come... We need to find our own way out."


No matter how cavernous it may be, we're still inside a building. I'm optimistic about this adventure, my mood buoyed by the conviction that, surely, we'd quickly find an exit by tomorrow. Indeed, I'm still quite composed about all this.


"When you're feeling down, food's the ticket."


I set my rucksack down and proceed to lay out a rather luxurious dinner. Though, at times like this, even a barely cooked meal would count as luxurious.


"Maybe we should start with the things that could go bad sooner."


I boil some water on the portable stove, transfer the liquid into a cup, and then toss in a portable food bar. The lard and butter that hold the bar together melt away, creating a nutritious meat-and-vegetable soup. It's terribly greasy. But it's just what our tired bodies need. It's delicious when paired with lightly roasted crackers and sausages. One bar is worth a thousand five hundred kilocalories. So greasy. So fattening.


If I were to eat this all the time, I'd probably end up with a ridiculous figure. As someone who loves sweets, I need to be careful about that.


Having finished our meal, we sip some coffee with marshmallows thrown in. Having entered a state of relaxation, I am assaulted by an extreme drowsiness.


We choose a spot on the grass and lie down.


I begin rotating a lever on the flashlight to replenish the battery charge I'd consumed till now.


"Winding it for a minute should give it thirty minutes of charge... And four minutes of winding would give us a hundred and twenty minutes..."


Considering there's a possibility that we might spend a long time wandering tomorrow as well, I'd like to keep winding for at least twenty minutes. Unfortunately, the act of turning this lever has the same effect as counting sheep.


"Zzz."


I fall into a peaceful sleep.


At seven in the morning, I wake up to cold, sterile light, entirely unlike that of the sun.


"Hm?"


When I wake up, my sleep-addled brain can't yet make sense of why I'm sprawled under a streetlamp. I sit up and inspect my surroundings, finally remembering that I'm here to investigate these ruins.


"... What a dull morning."


Even this light, that I had been so grateful for last night, now only serves to emphasize the feeling of claustrophobia within me.


The Assistant, who is beside me in his own sleeping bag, also begins to stir.


"Good morning."


"......"


He moves only his head, still slightly dazed.


"We're getting out of here today."


"......"


The Assistant weakly thrusts his fist into the air in agreement. He looks like he's about to fall asleep again.


"You look sleepy. Did you stay up late?"


"... Mm."


"Wha?"


He silently hands me the flashlight. It was in my hands yesterday. It's fully charged. I suppose he took over winding up the flashlight after I fell asleep.


"My, thank you, I appreciate it!"


I put my hands together, as is done in the East, towards this wonderfully caring and attentive assistant.


The Assistant looks troubled.


"I'll make oatmeal for breakfast as thanks."


The Assistant looks disgusted.


It's a natural reaction. No child likes oatmeal. It's only natural to think cornflakes taste better. I did too.


But we can't bring things like milk with us.


"It's pretty good once you get used to it, you know?"


It was served almost every day at the schoolhouse, so we'd eventually get used to it, or rather, give up on avoiding it. The oats would be mixed with hot water and, once done, garnished with raisins, which would at least add some flavor.


"While we're at it, how about we dispose of these oiled sardines as well. We might have a long way to go today, after all."


We have a surplus of food since I've packed so much.


I crack open the can and put the sardines, which gleam blue with oil, on some crackers along with onion slices. And that's it.


"Here you go, a sardine open sandwich."


The Assistant gingerly brings it to his mouth, hesitant. However, after the first bite, his eyes widen in surprise, and he proceeds to devour the rest with great gusto.


"Black tea in the morning is a must. Why, it may as well be considered a duty by law."


I've brought plenty of tea bags with me, so there's no need to hold back.


"Some milk or lemons would have been nice, but well, I can't ask for too much."


After a decently elegant breakfast, we pack up our things and get ready to leave.


And so, our exploration team of two makes its way through the darkness once more.


The construction is no less bizarre than it was before, and the unorganized hallways that wind every which way rob us explorers of even the semblance of a sense of direction.


We walk forward, up, and down.


We naturally stay silent as we march, so as to preserve our stamina. The monotonous rhythm of our echoing footsteps grows ever more hypnotic.


I don't usually pay attention to the sound of my shoes, but the more I walk, the more I feel like my steps are getting louder. It's probably just an illusion. Irritation is secretly gnawing away at my consciousness, and a nameless, itchy anxiety is slowly but surely occupying more and more of my mental faculties. All this time spent in this dark corridor is dissolving my senses of vision, hearing and temporal perception into one big indistinct heap.


After what feels like forever...


I'm hit by a sudden bout of thirst. But just as I mechanically bring my canteen to my mouth, I hear an erratic splash from within. It brings to my attention how much water remains, even when knowing that is the last thing I could wish for.


My chest tightens with anxiety as I think about how much water I have left.


We haven't run into any water bodies yet. I don't know if we'll be able to replenish our supplies in the future. Even if we don't have to worry about food yet, we'll need to reduce the amount we drink from now on.


The Assistant just nods nonchalantly when I tell him this.


What a specimen. He's the type to just calmly accept his fate.


Just the thought of being thrown in here without any equipment gives me chills. I'm so glad I stocked up.


"My mistake is that I didn't bring any paper with me."


"...?"


"You see, in the past, there used to be special notebooks with graph paper that they'd use to map out underground cave systems. I don't quite know why, but apparently, such paper was indispensable when making maps of complex caves. If you just want graph paper, they still make reproduction notebooks now, you know."


"......"


The Assistant signals his comprehension with a hmm-hmm.


"Also, according to one theory, in the generations that would come after, they would make maps using touch styluses. I haven't been able to figure out what a touch stylus is, though."


As I rattle off various trivial tidbits, the feeling of dizziness vanishes, and my composure returns.


It's probably better to talk than to stay silent.


It's eight o'clock at night. We've decided to pause our expedition and set up camp in the middle of a hallway. There's no lighting, and we have to bivouac in the dark. We might have tried to look further for a better spot if not for how extremely tired and hungry we've become. We could have managed if the path had been horizontal throughout, but after ten hours of ascending and descending all manner of stairs and ladders, it's no wonder we ran out of energy.


"This adventure is really overstaying its welcome..."


I will have to endure this reality which I can't even wish away.


At this point, we have no idea where the escape route could be. We can't even tell if we're close to an exit or not. The exit could be just one wall away from us, and we might have made any number of bad decisions that would prevent us from ever knowing it.


"To think even our compass would act up and start pointing every which way..."


This is a problem.


We lay out some food onto a picnic blanket, eat together, take turns winding up the flashlight, clean ourselves up with sanitizers that don't require water, and then crawl into our sleeping bags. The communicator is still out of service range.


The next morning, we have a light breakfast, get our outfits back in order, and set off.


Now that I've come this far, I'm no longer in such a hurry to escape. I'm more willing to take my time and make my way to an exit at a steady pace.


It isn't as if my newfound motivation somehow manifested some good luck too, but after about half an hour of walking, we begin to see faint changes to the unchanging hallway we are walking through.


At some point unknown to me, the right-hand side of the corridor has turned from a wall into a railing.


Railings are meant to prevent people from falling down. When I try reaching out as an experiment, there is no wall where there should have been. My fingers instead just claw at a vast expanse of empty space.


"We're on a catwalk now."


"...?"


"Huh? You're asking if this place is high? Yes, it's probably pretty high up. If you compare the city center to a single giant tower, this is a spiral staircase attached to the inner wall. This space is probably an atrium. Both the walls and this empty space were completely shrouded in darkness till now, which is probably why we didn't notice."


So, the question is, what did they set up this catwalk here for?


"Perhaps this is why the area we were wandering about in looked so half-done. These corridors are probably meant for maintenance."


"......"


Without waiting for a reply, I continue.


"This would also explain why it was so inhospitable. So if we keep going, we're sure to reach an area where people definitely lived."


The Assistant pulls out a chemical light.


I can immediately tell what he's trying to do.


"Please, give it a try."


He snaps the light and flings it over the railing. The stick, which glows blue, falls and falls, as far as the eye can see. The light fades into the distance, eventually reaching the size of a grain. We never hear the sound of it hitting the ground.


"... That's pretty deep."


The Assistant nods in agreement.


"But we've got one piece of information now. We're pretty high up in the building."


"...", Clap clap clap.


"Let's move on."


With some of the energy that had drained out of us regained, our pace quickens.


We head down the corridor with one hand on the railing. 


With his hand still on the railing, he headed down the corridor ahead. We walk for about forty to fifty minutes, only to be rewarded for our efforts with yet another uphill staircase.


"We have no choice but to go."


There's nothing else we can do. We climb the stairs, heading away from the passageway. The Assistant takes a chocolate bar out and splits it in two. He pops one piece into his mouth and hands me the rest.


"This is really starting to feel like an adventure now, isn't it."


I put the plain, unembellished piece of chocolate on my tongue. The numbing sweetness spreads through my mouth. Since we skipped lunch, I'll have to derive my energy from this chocolate.


About thirty minutes later.


We find a rough, unrefined iron door on the opposite side of the wall.


"This door seems quite sturdy."


The door is sealed tight with an immovable handle.


"I don't think my strength will cut it here. A little help, please?"


The two of us rotate the handle -- reminiscent of a ship's helm -- and pull on it. The door, thick as a slab of steak, slips out of the wall.


"Ngh!"


A flash of light.


An <i>explosion</i> of light burns my retinas.


The agony, bordering on physical pain, plunges me back into the darkness.


As I try to back away, I realize I've been pushing my body against the railing as hard as I can. I shudder.


What if the railing had given way, or if my body had toppled over...


"Be careful, Assistant. If you're too boisterous, you might end up falling over."


I can feel the boy's presence stirring right beside me.


My eyes can't respond to the light because I've been immersed in darkness for so long. My light-starved retinas, sensitive to even the dimmest glimmer, stand no chance against the sudden surge of light.


Indeed, on the other side of the door... is the outside world.


I turn myself away, my eyesight not having had the time to adjust to the sun's brightness.


Even just the blue of the sky feels painfully bright.


While I'm absorbed in gazing at the sky for the first time in several days, the Assistant tugs on my sleeve.


"... Yes?"


He catches my gaze with his placid eyes and points towards our feet.


Following his lead, I shift my gaze-


"Whoa."


We're in the middle of the city.


The very place I'd been warned to stay away from due to the extreme danger, walled off by an overcrowded agglomeration of high-rise buildings I'd once referred to as the "Baumkuchen"... We're somehow right in the middle of it!


"S-so high...!"


We're roughly five hundred meters up.


Immediately outside is a small landing, with needle-like stairs sticking out of the outer wall.


"Which happen to be broken!"


The stairs look extremely poorly built, given the height they are at. They were likely meant to fold out in a zigzag pattern when a connection to the ground was required, but as of now, a number of the steps in the middle have either been torn off or hang limp.


"Why would anybody build such flimsy stairs in such a windy place as this!?"


I take the Assistant by the hand and step back into the dark corridor.


The sturdiness of the catwalk's construction is leagues ahead of whatever exists of the outer wall stairs. Only after I can feel the catwalk under me again do my frayed nerves recover.


"And just when I thought we were out."


"..." The Assistant quietly points to one side.


The outer edge of the city stretches out in that direction.


But when I squint, I think I see several little dots milling about. Ah yes, I've brought a small scope with me.


"Oh, it's everyone from the investigation team."


Under magnification, it turns out each of those tiny dots was a human. It seems like they are surveying their assigned area.


It's nice and reassuring to have my comrades within my line of sight. But the problem is, my voice wouldn't be able to reach them even if I were to scream at the top of my lungs, and even if I could contact them, I don't know if they'd be able to come here and rescue us.


I can't help but laugh.


"For now, let's try the communicator again."


The signal's looking good. There's no static. Before long, the call connects, and I hear Grandfather's voice.


“Where are you?”


His tone is instantly interrogative.


Wouldn't a blood relative usually show some more concern, or be more gentle in how they address one in my situation?


"It's a long story."


"Make it short.”


"I got lost and made my way to the city's center."


I believe my explanation was quite short and to the point, but Grandfather merely lets out a brutish grunt and falls silent.


"It will be difficult for us to escape on our own. Please arrange for a rescue helicopter to be sent immediately."


“... It seems you have a special talent for getting into trouble, even without fairies being involved.”


"Please stop with the jibes. We really are in trouble right now."


“Then stop joking around about helicopters and whatnot. We don't have anything of the sort. You'd better come back soon. We haven't even started exploring that region yet. Don’t disturb the state of the ruins.”


I swear, I would be kinder to any child of my own. I am a victim of vicious verbal violence, inflicted by my own blood!


"... It's a labyrinth in here. We've been wandering around for a long time. I'll say it straight. <b><i>Please. Help. Me.</i></b>"


I hear a loud sigh. Message received, then.


“... Not even I understand much about that place.”


"Its construction is quite eccentric."


“Do you think you’ll find anything interesting?”


"Well, the whole place seems to have been left unfinished; there's absolutely nothing here."


"Where did you start from?"


"We went through a roller coaster of an elevator ride."


"What you're describing isn't an elevator. It's considered to have been a major means of urban transportation. Unfortunately, it's hard to pinpoint what route yours took, since there are mountains of them in there."


Isn't there anything we can do?


"... There was a huge monolith standing near the entrance. It had a human skeleton stuck to it."


"It had a <i>what</i>, now?”


I summarize everything that's happened so far.


"That's quite an interesting account... But even if we send in a rescue party now, they'd likely end up stranded themselves. Why didn't you get in touch until now?"


"It seems we can't use the communicators from within the structure."


“... There’s been a lot of debate as to why the city's center was made to be a single, huge, sealed structure, but it seems like the electromagnetic radiation shielding theory will take the lead now.”


"Grandfather, let's leave the questioning for later and get to figuring out how we're going to get out of here."


“... I’d love to have you extracted before the end of the day, but I can't promise anything. You're going to have to find your own way out. The place was designed to be inhabited by people. Escaping shouldn't be too difficult.”


An electronic beep sounds.


"Grandfather, my batteries are low."


"Which means it's time for action. If you disconnect right now and get moving, you should be able to get in touch one more time at least."


"U-Uhm, well, we're also running low on water, it's becoming a real problem."


"The structure likely isn't airtight. If you head down, you should be able to find some rainwater pooling somewhere. Also, you could... You know. You could always distill dirty water, or sewage, or the like.”


"That would be my last resort..."


“Then act quickly. You're wasting battery power. I'm hanging up for now. Good luck.”


The call ends.
